# 💰 Sumio

**Sumio** is a personal expense tracking Progressive Web App (PWA) that I built to replace my own habit of tracking expenses manually in notes and spreadsheets.

I wanted something **fast**, **offline-first**, and **visually clean**, without unnecessary complexity — so I built Sumio exactly the way I wanted to use it.

---

## ✨ Why Sumio?

Most expense apps are either:
- Too complex for daily use  
- Too minimal to be actually useful  

Sumio sits in the middle — structured, flexible, and calm to use.

## 🧠 Learnings

Building Sumio helped me deeply understand:

- State management without frameworks

- Mobile UX constraints
- Scalable data modeling using plain JavaScript

This project pushed me to think carefully about **architecture**, **performance**, and **long-term maintainability**.
